# ECTC Tournament App

This is an app for the ECTC that aims to improve communication between the
league and its participants (i.e., competitors and coaches).

## Project Info

This project was made by Joseph Lou as a semester-long Independent Work project
at Princeton University in Spring 2023, advised by Dr. Robert Dondero.

Helpful representatives from the ECTC included William Estey, Carissa Fu, and
Tara Sarathi (many thanks!).
