# ECTC Notifications App

This is an app for the ECTC that aims to improve communication between the
league and its participants (i.e., competitors and coaches) during tournaments.

## Deployment

This project is deployed live at https://ectc-notifications.onrender.com/. Due
to the free tier for the PostgreSQL database on Render, the deployment will be
suspended on June 23, 2023.

## Project Info

This project was made by Joseph Lou as a semester-long Independent Work project
at Princeton University in Spring 2023, advised by Dr. Robert Dondero.

Helpful representatives from the ECTC included William Estey, Carissa Fu, and
Tara Sarathi (many thanks!).

## Development

For a developer guide on information about how the codebase is structured and
what the system does, see [`DeveloperGuide.md`](DeveloperGuide.md).
